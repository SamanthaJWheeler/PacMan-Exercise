# pacmenExercise

The purpose of this project was to build a functioning feature of the popular game PacMan. The feature built displas and moves PacMan from one side of the screen to the other. 


How to Run: Select the index.html file and drag it into your browser's website bar. The index.html file will load in the browser and you will see PacMan moving across the screen. 

Roadmap of future improvements: Develop a PacMan Factory that produces more moving PacMan every 1 min.
